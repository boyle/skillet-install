This is a reinstall repository for Ubuntu 21.10 onto skillet, my
[Lenovo Carbon X1 Gen9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ThinkPad_X1_series#X1_Carbon_(9th_Gen)) laptop.

- `post-install` is run after the install media is completed
- `answer.cfg` is a record of a manual installation, replacing the existing
  21.02 installation

Also, [some hints](https://askubuntu.com/questions/1134965/preseed-install-ubuntu-18-04-with-wireless-peap-authentication) for building a preseed ISO that connects to wifi automatically.
